# JI_Thesis_2021-2022- Cosine Similarity & Readability

This Repository contains the. This project involves the analysis of the FoodData Central Branded Food Products database in terms of cosine similarity and readability. 

## Database
The FoodData Central Food Product Database is a USDA database containing information for US food products. The **branded_food** dataset is a subset of the Food Product Database containing product information for branded foods sold in the US.

## Folders
### Test
The test folder contains sample code for the cosine similarity analysis, as well as memory usage & runtime data. 

### Thesis
The "Thesis" folder contains all files necessary to run the cosine similarity analysis script, as well as data & figures for the analysis run on June 18, 2022. This folder contains two Jupyter IPython Notebook (.ipynb) files:
* Cosine_similarity_Analysis_process- which outlines the step-by-step process by which the. The steps are split into individual cells, 
* Cosine_similarity_Analysis_function- which contains the files necessary to define and apply the cosine similarity analysis process. This .ipynb file was converted into a .py file for use in another .ipynb file.
