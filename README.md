# JI_Thesis_2021-2022- Cosine Similarity & Readability

This Repository contains the files used in Joshua Idachaba's Master's thes. This project involves the analysis of the USDA Global Branded Food Products database (GBFPD) in terms of cosine similarity and readability. 

## Database
The [USDA Food Product Database](https://data.nal.usda.gov/dataset/usda-branded-food-products-database) is a USDA database containing information for US food products. The **branded_food** dataset is a subset of the Food Product Database containing product information for branded foods sold in the US.

## Folders
### Test
The test folder contains sample code for the cosine similarity analysis, as well as memory usage & runtime data. This

### Thesis
The "Thesis" folder contains all files necessary to run the cosine similarity analysis script, as well as data & figures for the analysis run on June 18, 2022. This folder contains two Jupyter IPython Notebook (.ipynb) files:
* Cosine_similarity_Analysis_process- which outlines the step-by-step process by which the cosine similarity analysis is run. The steps are split into individual cells, 1 per step 
* Cosine_similarity_Analysis_function- which contains the files necessary to define and apply the cosine similarity analysis process. This .ipynb file was converted into a .py file for use in another .ipynb file.
* batch_test-
* summary_statistics- Which contains the
